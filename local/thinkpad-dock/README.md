# README for Thinkpad Dock Scripts!
A lot of great information [https://gist.github.com/seanf/e3be5bf745395d50e975<Paste>](here)

## The Gist
---

* Add 81-thinkpad-dock.rules to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`
* Configure this script to point to wherever you are going to store `thinkpad-dock.sh`
* Check `thinkpad-dock.sh` and ensure that the username and `xrandr` declarations are correct

After that you should be good to go!
